# spring-22 Contributing Guide 

This document highlights the various contributing requirements for the automated wiki. This would allow the various automations we have setup to integrate your tutorial into the system. These requirements are built into test cases in a github action which will run when you submit a pull request with your tutorial, to be able to pass all those tests, all the requirements must be satisfied. This is to ensure consistency in our tutorials and allow for quality tutorials. 

## Markdown File Requirements

### Comment to Declare Topic 

Each tutorial must have a comment on the first line of the tutorial (befor). The comment should contain a number corresponding to the topics given below:

0 - Kubernetes
1 - Docker

For Example:

The comment with the number would tell the system which topic to place the tutorial into.
